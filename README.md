This project is about predicting if the first stage of Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket will successfully land.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. SpaceX can do the rocket launches relatively inexpensively.
